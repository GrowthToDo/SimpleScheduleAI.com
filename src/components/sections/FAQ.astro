  {
    question: "How long does it take to get started?",
    answer: "Under two weeks. You send us your staff list and shift structure via Excel. We configure the rules, run a test cycle, and hand you a draft schedule for review. No IT involvement required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do my nurses need to create accounts or download anything?",
    answer: "No. Your staff never touches the software. You get a PDF and Excel file by Thursday. That's it.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if we already have a scheduling system?",
    answer: "Most of our pilots come from teams using spreadsheets or a basic tool that doesn't enforce rules. We don't replace your EMR. We deliver the schedule so you don't have to build it.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle our unit-specific rules?",
    answer: "We configure them before your first cycle. Charge nurse requirements, skill mix ratios, on-call limits: all mapped to your unit. Changes take effect the next cycle.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who do we contact when there's a call-out at 2AM?",
    answer: "The system auto-generates replacement candidates as soon as a call-out is logged. You get the top 3 with reasons. One click to approve. You don't have to call us, but we're reachable if something unusual comes up.",
  },
